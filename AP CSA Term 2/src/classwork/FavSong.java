 *Y.O.U- Luh Kel
 *
 * If I said I need you by my side, just stay close to me
 * Just keep on holding me, telling me you won't ever leave
 * I feel like something inside me just keep controlling me
 * But you take all the pain, I need your energy
 * I, I, I'm needing you
 * I, I know you see me through
 * I, I, I'll be there for you
 * I, I, I'll be there for you
 * It's a different feeling when all of the checks on
 * I'ma trappin, I'ma trap until the pack gone
 * Sometimes I know I'm right but I feel wrong
 * When your arms not around me I feel all alone
 * I feel like I'm pacing, chasing, hoping I'ma make it
 * It's a lot of time, my-my-my life been super crazy
 * Praying that one day my brother get up out of them cages
 * You was there for me, I swear that I have peace, yes you
 * If I said I need you by my side, just stay close to me
 * Just keep on holding me, telling me you won't ever leave
 * I feel like something inside me just keep controlling me
 * But you take all the pain, I need your energy
 * I, I, I'm needing you
 * I, I know you see me through
 * I, I, I'll be there for you
 * I, I, I'll be there for you
 * Lately I've been in my mind, I feel I'm faded
 * Every time you come around my heart is racing
 * I'm grinding so hard I gotta make it
 * But you told me it's coming so I'm patient
 * I've been in my mind, I'm gone
 * It might take some time, I'm strong
 * I need you by my side because I need you
 * And when you tell me I'm that nigga boost my ego
 * All the way to the stars like the aliens
 * I know we ain't hit the top but girl we grazing it
 * When I look into your eyes it's some amazing shit
 * And girl you not in love just for the place I'm in
 * I, I, I'm needing you
 * I, I know you see me through
 * I, I, I'll be there for you
 * I, I, I'll be there for you
 * If I said I need you by my side, just stay close to me
 * Just keep on holding me, telling me you won't ever leave
 * I feel like something inside me just keep controlling me
 * But you take all the pain, I need your energy
 * I, I, I'm needing you
 * I, I know you see me through
 * I, I, I'll be there for you
 * I, I, I'll be there for you
 * I, I, I'm needing you
 * I, I know you see me through
 * I, I, I'll be there for you
 * I, I, I'll be there for you
 * I'll be there for you
 * I'll be there for you
 * Know you see me through
 * I, I, I'm needing you
